    "Python is one of the most popular programming languages today because of several key features that make it beginner-friendly, powerful, and versatile. Here are the main reasons why Python is widely used:\n",
    "    1. Python uses readable, English-like syntax, which makes it easy for beginners to learn and understand.\n",
    "    2. Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging and testing easier. it does not need to compile a compile a code before run it.\n",
    "    3. it is a dynamically typed language, it means in python no need to declare data type explicitly\n",
    "    4. it supports both oops and functional programming\n",
    "    5. Python community is very wide, so it's easy to find tutorial, documentation and support\n",
    "    6. Python provides a wide range of built-in modules and libraries for everything from math to web development to data analysis like Numpy, pandas, tensorflow, flask, etc.\n",
